\title{Select Top Gene Combinations Based on Clustering Metrics}
\usage{
selectTopCombinations(results, N, metric)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A named list containing the clustering results for each gene combination. Each element should be
a list of clustering results for the given gene combination, as produced by \code{valConsensus}.}

\item{N}{An integer specifying the number of top combinations to return.}

\item{metric}{A character string indicating the evaluation metric to use for ranking.
Possible values are \code{"Accuracy"}, \code{"Precision"}, \code{"Recall"}, and \code{"FScore"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the top N gene combinations, the average metric across all clustering methods
(\code{Mean_Metric}), and the individual metrics for each method.
}
\description{
Ranks and selects the top gene combinations based on the average value of a specified metric
across multiple clustering methods. Returns a data frame with the top N combinations and all evaluated metrics.
}
\details{
This function aggregates the results from multiple clustering methods for all tested gene combinations.
For each combination, it computes the mean of the specified metric across all methods and selects the top N combinations.
The resulting data frame includes the gene combination identifier, the average metric, and the individual
metrics for each method and metric type.
