Title: Framework for Biomarker Discovery and Validation in Transcriptomics
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Giorgio Montesi
Maintainer: Giorgio Montesi <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Provides an integrated and user-friendly workflow for analyzing transcriptomic data, including RNA-Seq and microarray experiments. 
    Implements automated data preprocessing with normalization and batch effect correction, multi-model classification with feature selection, 
    consensus biomarker identification, and robust external validation. Offers extensive visualizations—such as PCA, PVCA, AUROC, UpSet plots, 
    and heatmaps—to facilitate data exploration and model evaluation. Enables reproducible biomarker discovery by combining multiple machine learning 
    classifiers and consensus approaches, helping researchers identify and validate robust gene signatures.
